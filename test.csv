Thalcave,,Consistent,0.51,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || permit him to accept this disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was on fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged the words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave silently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always confident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can have no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's annoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them, the superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another. ""A bad omen,"" said Wilson. ""Yes, in the Highlands,"" replied Mulready. ""What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,"" added Wilson, sententiously. About noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the undulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread its broad carpet of verdure before them. More than once during the journey the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the horizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near them, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that it required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character. The weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less pleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature of the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to dissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic, and the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of this region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy clouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty miles, halted on the edge of a deep ""cañada,"" an immense natural ditch filled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for tents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean streams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every depression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already deep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the horses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous swamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it"

Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer. ""But we are none the less without an interpreter,"" said the major. ""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of"
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.505,"and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the || pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would have rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. ""These two ladies,"" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards them, ""hold a high rank in their country."" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed over his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a voice which he could scarcely control: ""Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed European? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?"" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said: ""That is your wife!"" ""No, mine!"" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady Helena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. ""Edward!"" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was filled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with one hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other the throng that was rushing upon the Europeans. [Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. ""Taboo! taboo!"" cried he.] At last his voice rose above the tumult. ""Taboo! taboo!"" cried he. At this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions, thus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after they were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but Robert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them. CHAPTER L. THE CHIEF'S FUNERAL. Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined the rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to persons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power to prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious hand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the offended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own insult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had"

Her resolution was immediately taken.

She told her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth Railroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after so many harassing thoughts, began to hope. Such was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady Glenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all those long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic daughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without hiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain Grant. As for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time: for he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister; comprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last, encircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain the cry that came from the very depths of his heart,-- ""Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!"" [Illustration: ""My father, my poor father!"" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.] Night had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of the two children, would not longer continue the conversation. Mary and Robert were conducted to their chambers, and fell asleep dreaming of a brighter future. After they had retired, Lady Helena saw the major, and told him all the events of the day. ""That Mary Grant is a brave girl,"" said MacNabb, when he had heard his cousin's story. ""May Heaven grant my husband success in his enterprise!"" replied Lady Helena; ""for the situation of the two children would be terrible!"" ""He will succeed,"" answered MacNabb, ""or the hearts of the authorities must be harder than the stone of Portland."" In spite of the major's assurance, Lady Helena passed the night in the greatest anxiety, and could scarce gain an hour's repose.

The mandolin resounded from every balcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and Concepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and children. Glenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this decline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and, without losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R. Bentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual received him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain Grant undertook to search along the entire coast. The question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of Chili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an event had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts of the country. But Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and, sparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast, but their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the people of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude that the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck. [Illustration: In Concepcion.] [Sidenote: ""TRY AGAIN!""] Glenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors. Mary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now six days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers were together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her words--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children of the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and was regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from it new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan, addressing him, said,-- ""Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made of this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?"" Paganel did not answer. He was reflecting. ""Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?"" continued Glenarvan. ""Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the mind?"" Paganel was still silent. ""In short,"" said Glenarvan, ""does not the word _Indian_ justify us still more?"" ""Perfectly,"" replied MacNabb. ""And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they wrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?"" ""There you are wrong, my dear lord,"""

""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || Britannia was lost forever, and her father dead! We must not, therefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the _Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her despair. It was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken.

Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.511,"on board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of sympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after this recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real interest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that Captain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From the fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other. Ayrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and simply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was carried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led a very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but he was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery. However, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He watched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight would plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night in October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge in the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots, edible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair, he wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by day and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers, mountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few travelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. ""And if Ayrton is pleased with me,"" said the Irish colonist, when the story was finished, ""I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest and intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house shall long be at his service."" Ayrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He probably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers ought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated a hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the conversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from Ayrton, when the major, addressing him, said: ""You were quartermaster of the Britannia?"" ""Yes,"" replied Ayrton. But perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however slight, had suggested this inquiry, || he added,-- ""I saved my contract from the wreck."" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said: ""My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the two months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find with him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true man, and worthy of your entire confidence."" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's honesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a paper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose writing Mary recognized immediately. It stated that ""Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow."" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity, for it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be in his hands and not belong to him. [Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.] ""Now,"" said Glenarvan, ""I appeal to you all for advice as to what is best to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us."" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: ""I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----"" ""Certainly,"" replied Glenarvan. ""I think, like you,"" continued Ayrton, ""that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives."" ""You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,"" said Paganel. ""The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?"" ""It is quite likely, sir,"" replied Ayrton. ""The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces."" ""This fact will complicate our search,"" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. ""How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.514,"Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked them in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his children had briefly told him the story of the Duncan. [Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout.] How great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman and her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor, had not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed the feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much simplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so pure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the trials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet with a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a child who does not think of hiding his emotion. Captain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her beautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing to Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not mistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously: ""How he has grown! He is a man!"" He lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand expressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of absence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had alike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans. When Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young girl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father. Lady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain proud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young hero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord Glenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary and concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been already informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his daughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord and Lady Glenarvan, said: ""My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!"" It was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain, who confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in || said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied the other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot for that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I have none!'"" [Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage.] CHAPTER XXV. BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER. Jacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly applauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer obtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody. However, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage. During the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a good sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The inmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden changes of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which had been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the example; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased their melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the recesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them. But before ""retiring to their nest,"" as Paganel said, Glenarvan, Robert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last time the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just set in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part of the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations, usually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could be distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's benefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant. [Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.] While the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon assumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined, gradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of threatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky. Its motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not a breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled the surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some huge pneumatic"

For a month, living on roots, edible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair, he wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by day and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers, mountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few travelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. ""And if Ayrton is pleased with me,"" said the Irish colonist, when the story was finished, ""I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest and intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house shall long be at his service."" Ayrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He probably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers ought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated a hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the conversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from Ayrton, when the major, addressing him, said: ""You were quartermaster of the Britannia?"" ""Yes,"" replied Ayrton. But perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however slight, had suggested this inquiry, || and Mulready, who were keeping guard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the major was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of a band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of Victoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her the number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at Seymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben Joyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a wide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster Ayrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major explained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or three almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between the quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation to pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the Duncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his care, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these facts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had transpired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of shrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near the suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile from the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays through the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the ground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. ""Here they are,"" said one. ""Yes,"" replied another, ""here is the trefoil of the hoofs again."" ""It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra."" ""All the horses are dead."" ""The poison is not far away."" ""There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This gastrolobium is a useful plant."" ""Then they were silent,"" added MacNabb, ""and departed. I wanted to know more: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning man, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with his invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of fortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned his name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees."
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.509,"native language ""The Irascible."" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from the delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high rank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry between the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's influence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful tribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview, although Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. ""You are English?"" said he. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality would probably facilitate an exchange. [Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.] ""And your companions?"" asked Kai-Koumou. ""My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if you care to know, we have taken no part in the war."" ""No matter,"" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. ""Every Englishman is our enemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages."" ""They have done wrong,"" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. ""I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power."" ""Listen,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: ""Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?"" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. ""I do not know,"" said he, after a moment's silence. ""Speak,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?"" ""No,"" answered Glenarvan. ""I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people."" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. ""Then you doubt it?"" said he. ""I do not know,"" repeated Glenarvan. ""Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?"" ""Not me alone,"" replied Glenarvan; ""but perhaps all of us."" ""Among the Maoris,"" said Kai-Koumou, ""it is one for one."" ""Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,"" answered Glenarvan, || his companions was settled. ""You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!"" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena and Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend that day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies connected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of an enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight of their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official mourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The soul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the fortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a magnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a crown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with oil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the mound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a funeral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the air. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His relations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their faces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than of tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their barbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the deceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his tribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished that he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness of this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover, the unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him; it was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such sacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated the virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final paroxysm of grief, she stretched herself at"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.527,"bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his hand very cordially to his unexpected guest. ""And now that our introduction is over,"" added he, ""will you permit me, Monsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?"" ""Twenty, my lord,"" replied Jacques Paganel; ""it will always be a pleasure to converse with you."" ""You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?"" ""Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had engaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on board. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that a good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and not stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you."" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs."" ""Then you would not care to visit another country?"" ""No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil."" ""Ah! you have a mission?"" ""Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846.

""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to"

Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the || his companions was settled.

Faria,Secret Society and Political Struggle,Consistent,0.511,"formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer. ""But we are none the less without an interpreter,"" said the major. ""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of || my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to"

""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search.""

Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages."" ""They have done wrong,"" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. ""I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power."" ""Listen,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: ""Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?"" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. ""I do not know,"" said he, after a moment's silence. ""Speak,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?"" ""No,"" answered Glenarvan. ""I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people."" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. ""Then you doubt it?"" said he. ""I do not know,"" repeated Glenarvan. ""Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?"" ""Not me alone,"" replied Glenarvan; ""but perhaps all of us."" ""Among the Maoris,"" said Kai-Koumou, ""it is one for one."" ""Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,"" answered Glenarvan, || and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the"
Noirtier,Wisdom and Influence in the Post-Revolution Era,Consistent,0.503,"kept your word, and I will keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall be abandoned."" ""Oh, it matters little to me,"" answered Ayrton. ""Return to your cabin now, and await our decision."" The quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors. ""This villain might have been a great man,"" observed the major. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan. ""He has a strong and self-reliant character. Why must his abilities be devoted to crime?"" ""But Harry Grant?"" ""I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them where their father is?"" ""I!"" cried Paganel. As we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and excitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He had listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered was worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once. ""You, Paganel!"" he exclaimed; ""do you know where Captain Grant is?"" ""As well as can be known,"" answered the geographer. ""And how do you know?"" ""By that everlasting document."" [Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.] ""Ah!"" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity. ""Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did not speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it was useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion corroborates mine."" ""Then New Zealand----?"" asked Glenarvan. ""Hear and judge,"" replied Paganel. ""I did not commit the blunder that saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter at Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain. You remember that we were in the cart. MacNabb had just told Lady Helena the story of the convicts, and had handed her the copy of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that gave an account of the accident at Camden Bridge. As I was writing, the paper lay on the ground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen, and these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind! 'Aland' was one of the very words in the English document,--a word that we had hitherto translated _ashore_, but which was the termination of the proper name Zealand."" ""Ha!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Yes,"" continued Paganel, with profound conviction, ""this interpretation had escaped me, and do you know why? Because my examinations were naturally confined more particularly to the French document, where this important || and his chin blunt. As for his eyes, they were hidden behind enormous eye-glasses, and his look seemed to have that indecision peculiar to nyctalops. His countenance indicated an intelligent and lively person, while it had not the crabbed air of those stern people who from principle never laugh, and whose stupidity is hidden beneath a serious guise. The nonchalance and amiable freedom of this unknown nonentity clearly proved that he knew how to take men and things at their best advantage. Even without his speaking you felt that he was a talker; but he was abstracted, after the manner of those who do not see what they are looking at or hear what they are listening to. He wore a traveling cap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon velvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets seemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a thousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak of a telescope which he carried in a sling. The curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the calmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him questioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the stranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan. When this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the indifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full length measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a sign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky and water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and resting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately the joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered passenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the foot of the mainmast. [Illustration] Any one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he did not even wink. The unknown then assumed his rôle. ""Steward!"" he cried, with an accent that betokened a foreigner. He waited. No one appeared. ""Steward!"" he repeated, in a louder tone. Mr. Olbinett was passing just then on his way to the kitchen under the forecastle. What was his astonishment to hear himself thus addressed by this tall individual, who was utterly unknown to him! ""Where"
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.508,"his companions was settled. ""You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!"" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena and Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend that day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies connected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of an enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight of their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official mourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The soul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the fortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a magnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a crown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with oil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the mound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a funeral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the air. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His relations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their faces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than of tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their barbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the deceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his tribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished that he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness of this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover, the unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him; it was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such sacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated the virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final paroxysm of grief, she stretched herself at || and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.

Thalcave,,Consistent,0.511,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses. ""Well,"" said he to the major, when the flock had disappeared, ""did you see them fly?"" ""Certainly,"" replied MacNabb; ""you could not do otherwise, unless you were blind. But let us hasten on, for we have fallen a mile behind."" When he had joined his companions, Paganel found Glenarvan in excited conversation with the Indian, whom he did not appear to understand. Thalcave had frequently stopped to examine the horizon, and each time his countenance expressed a lively astonishment. Glenarvan, not seeing his ordinary interpreter present, had attempted, but in vain, to question the Patagonian. So, as soon as he perceived the geographer at a distance, he cried,-- ""Come, friend Paganel, Thalcave and I can scarcely succeed in understanding each other."" Paganel conversed a few moments with the Indian, and, turning to Glenarvan, said,-- ""Thalcave is astonished at a circumstance that is really strange."" ""What?"" ""At meeting neither Indians, nor any traces of them, on these plains, which are usually furrowed with their trails, whether they are driving home the cattle stolen from the ranchos, or going to the Andes to sell their zorillo carpets and whips of braided leather."" ""And to what does Thalcave attribute this abandonment?"" ""He cannot tell; he is astonished. That is all."" ""But what Indians did he expect to find in this part of the Pampas?"" ""The very ones who have had foreign prisoners; those natives who are commanded by the caziques Calfoucoura, Catriel, and Yanchetruz."" ""Who are these caziques?"" [Illustration: Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly destroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses.] ""Chiefs of tribes that were very powerful thirty years ago, before they were driven beyond the sierras. Since that time they have been subdued as much as an Indian can be, and now scour the Pampas as well as the province of Buenos Ayres. I am therefore astonished, like Thalcave, at not encountering traces of them in a country where they generally pursue the calling of plunderers."" ""Well, then,"" inquired Glenarvan, ""what course ought we to take?"" ""I will see,"" replied Paganel. After a few moments' conversation with Thalcave, he said,-- ""This is his advice, which seems to me very wise. We must"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.515,"bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his hand very cordially to his unexpected guest. ""And now that our introduction is over,"" added he, ""will you permit me, Monsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?"" ""Twenty, my lord,"" replied Jacques Paganel; ""it will always be a pleasure to converse with you."" ""You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?"" ""Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had engaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on board. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that a good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and not stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you."" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs."" ""Then you would not care to visit another country?"" ""No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil."" ""Ah! you have a mission?"" ""Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not || speak?"" ""Because, however just this interpretation may be, it cannot contribute to the captain's rescue."" ""Why, Paganel?"" ""Because, admitting that Captain Grant was wrecked on the coast of New Zealand, as long as he has not made his appearance for two years since the disaster, he must have fallen a victim to the sea or the savages."" ""Then your opinion is----?"" asked Glenarvan. ""That we might perhaps find some traces of the shipwreck, but that the seamen of the Britannia have perished."" ""Keep all this silent, my friends,"" replied Glenarvan, ""and leave me to choose the time for telling this sad news to the children of Captain Grant."" CHAPTER LVIII. A CRY IN THE NIGHT. The crew soon learned that Ayrton's disclosures had not thrown light upon the situation of Captain Grant. The despair on board was profound, for they had relied on the quartermaster, who, however, knew nothing that could put the Duncan on the track of the Britannia. The yacht therefore continued on the same course, and the only question now was to choose the island on which to leave Ayrton. Paganel and Captain Mangles consulted the maps on board. Exactly on the thirty-seventh parallel was an island, generally known by the name of Maria Theresa, a lone rock in the midst of the Pacific, three thousand five hundred miles from the American coast, and one thousand five hundred miles from New Zealand. No ship ever came within hail of this solitary isle; no tidings from the world ever reached it. Only the storm-birds rested here during their long flights, and many maps do not even indicate its position. If anywhere absolute isolation was to be found on earth, it was here, afar from the ocean's traveled highways. Its situation was made known to Ayrton, who consented to live there; and the vessel was accordingly headed towards the island. Two days later the lookout hailed land on the horizon. It was Maria Theresa, low, long, and scarcely emerging from the waves, appearing like some enormous sea-monster. Thirty miles still lay between it and the yacht, whose prow cut the waves with such speed that soon the island grew distinct. The sun, now sinking towards the west, defined its outlines in glowing light. Several slight elevations were tinged with the last rays of the day. At five o'clock Captain Mangles thought he distinguished a faint smoke rising towards the"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.511,"Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked them in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his children had briefly told him the story of the Duncan. [Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout.] How great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman and her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor, had not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed the feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much simplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so pure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the trials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet with a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a child who does not think of hiding his emotion. Captain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her beautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing to Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not mistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously: ""How he has grown! He is a man!"" He lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand expressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of absence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had alike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans. When Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young girl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father. Lady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain proud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young hero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord Glenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary and concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been already informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his daughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord and Lady Glenarvan, said: ""My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!"" It was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain, who confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in || the members of such an expedition?"" asked Glenarvan. ""The fewer the better. The only point is to ascertain the situation of Captain Grant, and not to engage in combat with the Indians. I think that Lord Glenarvan, as our chief, the major, who would yield his place to no one, your servant Jacques Paganel----"" ""And I!"" cried Robert Grant. ""Robert?"" said Mary. ""And why not?"" answered Paganel. ""Travels develop youth. We four, then, and three sailors of the Duncan----"" ""What,"" exclaimed Captain Mangles, ""your lordship does not intercede for me?"" ""My dear fellow,"" replied Glenarvan, ""we shall leave the ladies on board, the dearest objects we have in the world. Who would watch over them, if not the devoted captain of the Duncan?"" ""We cannot accompany you, then,"" said Lady Helena, whose eyes were dimmed by a mist of sadness. ""My dear wife,"" replied Glenarvan, ""our journey will be performed with unusual rapidity, our separation will be short, and----"" [Illustration: The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones.] [Sidenote: GOOD AFTERNOON!] ""Yes, yes; I understand you,"" answered Lady Helena. ""Go, then, and may you succeed in your enterprise."" ""Besides, this is not a journey,"" added Paganel. ""What is it, then?"" asked Lady Helena. ""A passage, nothing more. We shall pass, that is all, like honest men, over the country and do all the good possible. '_Transire benefaciendo_' is our motto."" With these words the discussion ended. The preparations were begun that very day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order not to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of departure. When they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered their services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred to have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men. This was accordingly done; and the mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones. Lord Glenarvan had displayed great energy in his preparations, for he wished to be ready at the day appointed; and he was. Captain Mangles likewise supplied his ship with coal, that he might put to sea at any moment. He wished to gain the Argentine shore before the travelers. Hence there was a real rivalry between Glenarvan and the captain, which was of advantage to both."
Noirtier,Involvement and Turning Point in the French Revolution,Consistent,0.51,"meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?"" ""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || [Sidenote: SEALS AND SIRENS.] Paganel, as usual, upon being appealed to, could tell them of the rise, extension, and consolidation of the British power upon the island; he informed them of the beginnings--and, to his belief, of the causes--of the strife which for years decimated the aborigines, and was very injurious to the colonists who had emigrated; then, in reply to Robert's questions, he went on to speak of those who on a narrower theatre had emulated by their heroism and patience the deeds of the world's great travelers and scientific explorers. He told them of Witcombe and Charlton Howitt, men known in their own circles and in connection with their own branch of the New Zealand government. At still greater length he detailed the adventures of Jacob Louper, who was the companion of Witcombe, and had gone as his assistant to discover a practicable route over the mountains in the north of the province of Canterbury. In those mountain wilds, which even the islanders rarely traverse, these two Europeans suffered greatly, but still worse was their fate when they descended to the water-level and essayed to cross the Taramakau near its mouth. Jacob Louper at length found two old and almost useless canoes, and by attaching the one to the other they hoped to accomplish the passage safely. Before they had reached the middle of the rapid current, however, both the tubs capsized. Louper, with difficulty, managed to support himself on one of them, and by clinging to it was at length carried to the river's bank, which his companion also reached; but when after a period of insensibility Louper returned to consciousness and found the body of Witcombe, it was lifeless. Though terribly bruised and still bleeding from his wounds, Louper hollowed a grave for the remains, and then, after many more days of privation and danger, came to the huts of some of the Maoris, by whose assistance he at length reached the settled parts of the colony. These facts and reminiscences, it must be confessed, were not of the most inspiriting character; but they were in the same key as most of Paganel's disquisitions and information concerning these islands, and they were before a late hour exchanged for peaceful though probably dreamy slumbers, by his hearers. Early the next morning the signal for departure was given. The rain had ceased during the night, and the sky"

Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs."" ""Then you would not care to visit another country?"" ""No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil."" ""Ah! you have a mission?"" ""Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin.

We must not, therefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the _Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her despair. It was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken. Even if she should learn that her father's dead body had been found on a desert coast, or in the hull of a shipwrecked vessel, it was better than this continual doubt, this eternal torment of uncertainty. She told her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth Railroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after so many harassing thoughts, began to hope. Such was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady Glenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all those long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic daughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without hiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain Grant. As for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time: for he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister; comprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last, encircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain the cry that came from the very depths of his heart,-- ""Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!"" [Illustration: ""My father, my poor father!"" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.] Night had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of the two children, would not longer continue the conversation. Mary and Robert were conducted to their chambers, and fell asleep dreaming of a brighter future. After they had retired, Lady Helena saw the major, and told him all the events of the day. ""That Mary Grant is a brave girl,"" said MacNabb, when he had heard his cousin's story. ""May Heaven grant my husband success in his enterprise!"" replied Lady Helena; ""for the situation of the two children would be terrible!"" ""He will succeed,"" answered MacNabb, ""or the hearts of the authorities must be harder than the stone of Portland."" In spite of the major's assurance, Lady Helena passed the night in the greatest anxiety, and could scarce gain an hour's repose. [Sidenote: ""BROKEN CISTERNS.""] The next morning Mary"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.517,"bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his hand very cordially to his unexpected guest. ""And now that our introduction is over,"" added he, ""will you permit me, Monsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?"" ""Twenty, my lord,"" replied Jacques Paganel; ""it will always be a pleasure to converse with you."" ""You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?"" ""Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had engaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on board. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that a good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and not stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you."" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life.

It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not || repay the disinterested generosity of the brave guide; but at last a happy idea occurred to him. He drew from his pocket-book a costly medallion inclosing an admirable portrait, one of Lawrence's master-pieces, and presented it to Thalcave. ""My wife,"" said Glenarvan. Thalcave gazed with wonder at the portrait, and pronounced these simple words,-- ""Good and beautiful!"" Then Robert, Paganel, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors bade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each one in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at parting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him to accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the Indian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's most precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but caresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka. [Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves.] At that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the narrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach. ""My wife?"" asked Glenarvan. ""My sister?"" cried Robert. ""Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,"" replied the cockswain. ""But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning to ebb."" The last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his friends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian took him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly. ""Now go,"" said he; ""you are a man!"" ""Adieu, my friend, adieu!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Shall we ever see each other again?"" asked Paganel. ""Who knows?"" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven. They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct, and soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan. Robert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself upon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with their joyous shouts. Thus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America on a rigorously straight line."
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.512,"Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert, of the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less fortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris, who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance, who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief spoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how matters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was ""Hihy"" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The spectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he attached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by strong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly treated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he was a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture, his condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate friends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and escaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief, knew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain, and that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take refuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were held captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's tomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his friends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance of his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led them to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous congratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the present. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they did not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst would force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time, and the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the difficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which Providence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend it, || in his hands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his frenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. ""Now, Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""be candid. I acknowledge that your absent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the Duncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we should have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange association of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write New Zealand instead of Australia?"" ""Very well,"" said Paganel. ""It was----"" But at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he stopped short, finally replying: ""Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible being, and shall die a most famous blunderer!"" The affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's presence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved, thought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a good breakfast. However, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and Robert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom Austin with them. They wished to question him further. ""Now, Tom,"" said Glenarvan, ""let me know: did not this order to sail for the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?"" ""Yes, my lord,"" replied Austin. ""I was very much surprised; but, as I am not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could I act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your instructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done differently, captain?"" ""No, Tom,"" answered Captain Mangles. ""But what did you think?"" asked Glenarvan. ""I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was necessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of circumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that I was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover, on leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did not know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had disappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me very much."" ""What do you mean, Tom?"" inquired Glenarvan. ""I mean,"" he replied, ""that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned, the day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----"" ""Ayrton!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Is"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.513,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || permit him to accept this disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was on fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged the words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave silently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always confident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can have no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's annoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them, the superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another. ""A bad omen,"" said Wilson. ""Yes, in the Highlands,"" replied Mulready. ""What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,"" added Wilson, sententiously. About noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the undulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread its broad carpet of verdure before them. More than once during the journey the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the horizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near them, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that it required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character. The weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less pleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature of the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to dissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic, and the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of this region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy clouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty miles, halted on the edge of a deep ""cañada,"" an immense natural ditch filled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for tents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean streams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every depression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already deep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the horses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous swamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it"

""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.502,"a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses. ""Well,"" said he to the major, when the flock had disappeared, ""did you see them fly?"" ""Certainly,"" replied MacNabb; ""you could not do otherwise, unless you were blind. But let us hasten on, for we have fallen a mile behind."" When he had joined his companions, Paganel found Glenarvan in excited conversation with the Indian, whom he did not appear to understand. Thalcave had frequently stopped to examine the horizon, and each time his countenance expressed a lively astonishment. Glenarvan, not seeing his ordinary interpreter present, had attempted, but in vain, to question the Patagonian. So, as soon as he perceived the geographer at a distance, he cried,-- ""Come, friend Paganel, Thalcave and I can scarcely succeed in understanding each other."" Paganel conversed a few moments with the Indian, and, turning to Glenarvan, said,-- ""Thalcave is astonished at a circumstance that is really strange."" ""What?"" ""At meeting neither Indians, nor any traces of them, on these plains, which are usually furrowed with their trails, whether they are driving home the cattle stolen from the ranchos, or going to the Andes to sell their zorillo carpets and whips of braided leather."" ""And to what does Thalcave attribute this abandonment?"" ""He cannot tell; he is astonished. That is all."" ""But what Indians did he expect to find in this part of the Pampas?"" ""The very ones who have had foreign prisoners; those natives who are commanded by the caziques Calfoucoura, Catriel, and Yanchetruz."" ""Who are these caziques?"" [Illustration: Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly destroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses.] ""Chiefs of tribes that were very powerful thirty years ago, before they were driven beyond the sierras. Since that time they have been subdued as much as an Indian can be, and now scour the Pampas as well as the province of Buenos Ayres. I am therefore astonished, like Thalcave, at not encountering traces of them in a country where they generally pursue the calling of plunderers."" ""Well, then,"" inquired Glenarvan, ""what course ought we to take?"" ""I will see,"" replied Paganel. After a few moments' conversation with Thalcave, he said,-- ""This is his advice, which seems to me very wise. We must || Glenarvan shot a peccary, which was very good eating. In less than half an hour they had obtained without difficulty all the game they needed. Robert captured a curious animal called an armadillo, which was covered with a sort of helmet of movable bony pieces and measured a foot and a half in length. It was very fat, and would be an excellent dish, as the Patagonian said; while Robert was proud of his success. As for Thalcave, he showed his companions a ""nandou"" hunt. This bird, peculiar to the Pampas, is a kind of ostrich, whose swiftness is marvelous. The Indian did not try to decoy so nimble an animal, but urged his horse to a gallop, straight towards the bird, so as to overtake it at once, for, if the first attack should fail, the nandou would soon fatigue both horse and rider with its giddy backward and forward movements. Thalcave, arriving at a proper distance, launched his ""bolas"" with a strong hand, and so skillfully that they twisted about the legs of the ostrich and paralyzed its efforts. In a few moments it lay on the ground. The Indian soon captured his prize and contributed it to the common repast. The string of partridges, Thalcave's ostrich, Glenarvan's peccary, and Robert's armadillo were brought back to camp. The ostrich and the peccary were immediately stripped of their skin and cut into small slices. As for the armadillo, it is a dainty animal which carries its roasting dish with it, and it was, accordingly, placed in its own bony covering on the glowing embers. The three hunters were satisfied with the partridges for supper, and kept the rounds of beef for their friends. This repast was washed down with clear water, which was then considered superior to all the wines in the world. The horses were not forgotten. A great quantity of dry fodder, piled in the ramada, served them for food and bedding. [Sidenote: DESERT SILENCE.] When everything was ready, Glenarvan, Robert, and the Indian wrapped themselves in their ponchos, and stretched their limbs on a bundle of alfafares, the usual bed of the hunters of the Pampas. CHAPTER XIX. THE RED WOLVES. Night came,--the night of the new moon, only the uncertain light of the stars illumined the plain. On the horizon the zodiacal light faded away in a dark mist.

Noirtier,Political Awakening in Youth,Consistent,0.516,"to gradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he entangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the convicts he commanded."" Everything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had just been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a bold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved, and required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately, there was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet thought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward to the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He understood what was passing in her mind. ""Miss Mary!"" cried he, ""you are weeping!"" ""What is the matter, my child?"" asked Lady Helena. ""My father, madam, my father!"" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of each. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her eyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips. The discovery of Ayrton's treachery destroyed all hope. The convict, to entice Glenarvan on, had invented a shipwreck. In their conversation, overheard by MacNabb, his accomplices had clearly confessed it. The Britannia had never been wrecked on the reefs of Twofold Bay! Harry Grant had never set foot on the Australian continent! For the second time an erroneous interpretation of the document had set the searchers of the Britannia on a false trail. All, in the face of this situation and the grief of the two children, preserved a mournful silence. Who then could have found words of hope? Robert wept in his sister's arms. Paganel murmured, in a voice of despair,-- [Sidenote: CALM AND CLOUDINESS.] ""Ah, unlucky document! You can boast of having sorely puzzled the brains of a dozen brave people!"" And the worthy geographer was fairly furious against himself, and frantically beat his forehead. In the mean time Glenarvan had joined Mulready and Wilson, who were on guard without. A deep silence reigned on the plain lying between the wood and the river. Heavy clouds covered the vault of the sky. In this deadened and torpid atmosphere the least sound would have been clearly transmitted; but nothing was heard. Ben Joyce and his band must have fled to a || meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?"" ""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander.

Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.51,"I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him || he added,-- ""I saved my contract from the wreck."" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said: ""My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the two months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find with him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true man, and worthy of your entire confidence."" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's honesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a paper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose writing Mary recognized immediately. It stated that ""Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow."" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity, for it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be in his hands and not belong to him. [Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.] ""Now,"" said Glenarvan, ""I appeal to you all for advice as to what is best to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us."" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: ""I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----"" ""Certainly,"" replied Glenarvan. ""I think, like you,"" continued Ayrton, ""that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives."" ""You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,"" said Paganel. ""The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?"" ""It is quite likely, sir,"" replied Ayrton. ""The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces."" ""This fact will complicate our search,"" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. ""How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the"

""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || Britannia was lost forever, and her father dead! We must not, therefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the _Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her despair. It was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken. Even if she should learn that her father's dead body had been found on a desert coast, or in the hull of a shipwrecked vessel, it was better than this continual doubt, this eternal torment of uncertainty. She told her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth Railroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after so many harassing thoughts, began to hope. Such was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady Glenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all those long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic daughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without hiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain Grant. As for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time: for he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister; comprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last, encircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain the cry that came from the very depths of his heart,-- ""Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!"" [Illustration: ""My father, my poor father!"" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.] Night had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of the two children, would not longer continue the conversation. Mary and Robert were conducted to their chambers, and fell asleep dreaming of a brighter future. After they had retired, Lady Helena saw the major, and told him all the events of the day. ""That Mary Grant is a brave girl,"" said MacNabb, when he had heard his cousin's story. ""May Heaven grant my husband success in his enterprise!"" replied Lady Helena; ""for the situation of the two children would be terrible!"" ""He will succeed,"" answered MacNabb, ""or the hearts of the authorities must be harder than the stone of Portland."" In spite of the major's assurance, Lady Helena passed the night in the greatest anxiety, and could scarce gain an hour's repose. [Sidenote: ""BROKEN CISTERNS.""] The next morning Mary"

""But we are none the less without an interpreter,"" said the major. ""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of || meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?""

""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.517,"on board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of sympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after this recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real interest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that Captain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From the fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other. Ayrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and simply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was carried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led a very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but he was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery. However, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He watched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight would plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night in October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge in the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots, edible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair, he wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by day and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers, mountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few travelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. ""And if Ayrton is pleased with me,"" said the Irish colonist, when the story was finished, ""I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest and intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house shall long be at his service."" Ayrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He probably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers ought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated a hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the conversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from Ayrton, when the major, addressing him, said: ""You were quartermaster of the Britannia?"" ""Yes,"" replied Ayrton. But perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however slight, had suggested this inquiry, || I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way.

On the 26th of July, 1864, under a strong gale from the northeast, a magnificent yacht was steaming at full || reassured at seeing that the superstition of the Maoris was still stronger than their rage, entered the tomb. It was a palisade of red painted stakes. Symbolical faces, a real tattooing on wood, described the nobleness and exploits of the deceased. Strings of pipes, shells, and carved stones extended from one stake to another. Inside, the earth was hidden beneath a carpet of green leaves. In the centre a slight protuberance marked the freshly-made grave. Here reposed the weapons of the chief, his guns loaded and primed, his lance, his splendid hatchet of green jade, with a supply of powder and balls sufficient for the hunts of the other world. ""Here is a whole arsenal,"" said Paganel, ""of which we will make a better use than the deceased. It is a good idea of these savages to carry their weapons to heaven with them."" ""But these are English guns!"" said the major. ""Doubtless,"" replied Glenarvan; ""it is a very foolish custom to make presents of fire-arms to the savages, who then use them against the invaders, and with reason. At all events, these guns will be useful to us."" ""But still more useful,"" said Paganel, ""will be the provisions and water intended for Kara-Tété."" The parents and friends of the dead had, indeed, faithfully fulfilled their duties. The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues of the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen days, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns, sweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the Europeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets, artistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum. The fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against hunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal at the chief's expense. Glenarvan directed Mr. Olbinett's attention to the food necessary for his companions; but he, with his usual exactness, even in critical situations, thought the bill of fare rather scanty. Moreover, he did not know how to prepare the roots, and there was no fire. But Paganel solved the difficulty, and advised him to simply bury his ferns and potatoes in the ground itself, for the heat of the upper strata was very great. Olbinett, however, narrowly escaped a serious scalding, for, just as he had dug a hole to put his roots"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.516,"he added,-- ""I saved my contract from the wreck."" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said: ""My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the two months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find with him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true man, and worthy of your entire confidence."" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's honesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a paper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose writing Mary recognized immediately. It stated that ""Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow."" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity, for it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be in his hands and not belong to him. [Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.] ""Now,"" said Glenarvan, ""I appeal to you all for advice as to what is best to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us."" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: ""I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----"" ""Certainly,"" replied Glenarvan. ""I think, like you,"" continued Ayrton, ""that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives."" ""You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,"" said Paganel. ""The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?"" ""It is quite likely, sir,"" replied Ayrton. ""The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces."" ""This fact will complicate our search,"" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. ""How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the || I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him"
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.507,"and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the || the foot of the mound, beating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate victim rose; but a violent blow with the ""méré,"" a formidable club, wielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the captives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for the funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies lay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could not alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of Nouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and mistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced to slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the severest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed, and compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to the Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude for eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished at a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all bonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this death was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were reserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the victims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible details. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide this awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now understood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel tortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with horror. The funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an indigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer human. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw themselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at their frenzy? [Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible details.] [Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.511,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him with a dark foreboding. ""He is leaving us!"" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as though he were about to mount. ""He? never!"" said Robert. In truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his friends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready. He champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot forth lightning flashes; he understood his master. Just as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught him by the arm with a convulsive grasp. ""You are going?"" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted. ""Yes,"" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his companion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however perfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which signified: ""Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him."" [Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.] ""Ha! Thalcave!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Quick, quick!"" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert, in a voice broken by emotion,-- ""Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will rush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon himself."" ""Friend Thalcave,"" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the Patagonian, ""friend Thalcave, do not leave us!"" ""No,"" said Glenarvan, ""he will not leave us."" And, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses crowding against the stakes,-- ""Let us go together."" ""No,"" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these words. ""Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse."" ""Very well,"" said Glenarvan. ""Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He shows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with you."" Then, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,-- ""I will go."" ""No,"" replied the Patagonian, calmly. ""I tell you,"" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the Indian, ""I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!"" Glenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But what matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell all, and men quickly understand each other. [Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.] However, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The danger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.517,"bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his hand very cordially to his unexpected guest. ""And now that our introduction is over,"" added he, ""will you permit me, Monsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?"" ""Twenty, my lord,"" replied Jacques Paganel; ""it will always be a pleasure to converse with you."" ""You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?"" ""Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had engaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on board. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that a good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and not stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you."" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs."" ""Then you would not care to visit another country?"" ""No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil."" ""Ah! you have a mission?"" ""Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not || sand of a park, the floor of a house, or the deck of a vessel to this aerial abode."" ""Glenarvan,"" said Paganel, ""we must take things as they come. If favorable, so much the better; if unfavorable, we must not mind it. I see you long for the comforts of Malcolm Castle."" ""No, but----"" ""I am certain that Robert is perfectly happy,"" interrupted Paganel, to secure one advocate, at least, of his theories. ""Yes, Monsieur Paganel!"" cried the boy, in a joyful tone. ""It is natural at his age,"" replied Glenarvan. ""And at mine,"" added the geographer. ""The less ease we have, the fewer wants; the fewer wants, the happier we are."" ""Well,"" said the major, ""here is Paganel going to make an attack upon riches and gilded splendor."" ""No, my dear major,"" continued Paganel; ""but, if you wish, I will tell you, in this connection, a little Arab story that occurs to me."" ""Yes, yes, Monsieur Paganel,"" cried Robert. ""And what will your story prove?"" asked the major. ""What all stories prove, my brave companion."" ""Not much, then,"" replied MacNabb. ""But go on, Scheherezade, and tell one of those stories that you relate so well."" ""There was once upon a time,"" said Paganel, ""a son of the great Haroun-al-Raschid who was not happy. He accordingly consulted an old dervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to find in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way to procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince. 'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.' Thereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his talisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts of kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he was no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and merchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without finding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts, he was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his father, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously singing as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses happiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.' He approached him. 'Good man,'"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.515,"I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related.

A poisonous plant enabled him || and Mulready, who were keeping guard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the major was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of a band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of Victoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her the number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at Seymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben Joyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a wide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster Ayrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major explained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or three almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between the quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation to pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the Duncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his care, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these facts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had transpired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of shrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near the suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile from the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays through the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the ground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. ""Here they are,"" said one. ""Yes,"" replied another, ""here is the trefoil of the hoofs again."" ""It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra."" ""All the horses are dead."" ""The poison is not far away."" ""There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This gastrolobium is a useful plant."" ""Then they were silent,"" added MacNabb, ""and departed. I wanted to know more: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning man, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with his invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of fortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned his name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees."
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.513,"added, in conclusion, ""misfortunes are sometimes beneficial, and I do not regret my error."" ""And why, my worthy friend?"" asked the major. ""Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two languages instead of one."" ""By my faith, I should not have thought of that,"" replied MacNabb. ""My compliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!"" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not, however, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the young captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign from Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at the two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed the captain, but upon a different subject. ""How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?"" he inquired. ""Excellently,"" replied the captain; ""only I must inform your lordship that we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan."" ""What!"" cried Paganel, ""you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!"" ""Hang yourself!"" said the major. ""Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my rope!"" retorted the geographer. ""Well, my dear Paganel,"" added Glenarvan, ""unless we are endowed with ubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you could not at the same time double Cape Horn."" ""Nevertheless, I am sorry,"" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated by Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,-- ""My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your noble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased with his ship."" ""Oh, how could I be?"" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps also at the young captain. ""My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,"" cried Robert, ""and I do too."" ""And I return your love, my dear boy,"" replied Captain Mangles, a little confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to the face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the captain added,-- ""Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give us a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young hero?"" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. || bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France.

Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion.

""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of"
Faria,Addendum to Character Relationships,Consistent,0.512,"am very indiscreet."" Thus far the Duncan had acquitted herself admirably: in every way her powers for steaming or sailing had been sufficiently tested, and her captain and passengers were alike satisfied with her performance and with one another. [Illustration] CHAPTER IX. THROUGH THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN. The joy on board was general, when Paganel's resolution was known. Young Robert threw himself on his neck with very demonstrative delight. The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. ""A rough little gentleman,"" said he; ""I will teach him geography."" As Captain Mangles had engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a boy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant a pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become one day an accomplished gentleman. The Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these gloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of Brazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the north, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected without difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in search of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their captain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence proceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at heart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly interested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well, that, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had perceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with Mr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major, who was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at dinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's chests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman resolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would facilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for philology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on arriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard incessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. || repay the disinterested generosity of the brave guide; but at last a happy idea occurred to him. He drew from his pocket-book a costly medallion inclosing an admirable portrait, one of Lawrence's master-pieces, and presented it to Thalcave. ""My wife,"" said Glenarvan. Thalcave gazed with wonder at the portrait, and pronounced these simple words,-- ""Good and beautiful!"" Then Robert, Paganel, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors bade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each one in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at parting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him to accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the Indian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's most precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but caresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka. [Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves.] At that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the narrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach. ""My wife?"" asked Glenarvan. ""My sister?"" cried Robert. ""Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,"" replied the cockswain. ""But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning to ebb."" The last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his friends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian took him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly. ""Now go,"" said he; ""you are a man!"" ""Adieu, my friend, adieu!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Shall we ever see each other again?"" asked Paganel. ""Who knows?"" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven. They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct, and soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan. Robert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself upon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with their joyous shouts. Thus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America on a rigorously straight line."
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.51,"and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the || native language ""The Irascible."" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from the delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high rank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry between the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's influence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful tribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview, although Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. ""You are English?"" said he. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality would probably facilitate an exchange. [Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.] ""And your companions?"" asked Kai-Koumou. ""My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if you care to know, we have taken no part in the war."" ""No matter,"" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. ""Every Englishman is our enemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages."" ""They have done wrong,"" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. ""I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power."" ""Listen,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: ""Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?"" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. ""I do not know,"" said he, after a moment's silence. ""Speak,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?"" ""No,"" answered Glenarvan. ""I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people."" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. ""Then you doubt it?"" said he. ""I do not know,"" repeated Glenarvan. ""Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?"" ""Not me alone,"" replied Glenarvan; ""but perhaps all of us."" ""Among the Maoris,"" said Kai-Koumou, ""it is one for one."" ""Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,"" answered Glenarvan,"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.508,"I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him || he added,-- ""I saved my contract from the wreck."" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said: ""My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the two months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find with him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true man, and worthy of your entire confidence."" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's honesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a paper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose writing Mary recognized immediately. It stated that ""Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow."" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity, for it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be in his hands and not belong to him. [Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.] ""Now,"" said Glenarvan, ""I appeal to you all for advice as to what is best to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us."" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: ""I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----"" ""Certainly,"" replied Glenarvan. ""I think, like you,"" continued Ayrton, ""that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives."" ""You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,"" said Paganel. ""The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?"" ""It is quite likely, sir,"" replied Ayrton. ""The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces."" ""This fact will complicate our search,"" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. ""How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the"
Faria,The Origin of Political Intrigue,Consistent,0.515,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || when the latter was corresponding member of the Society! He it was who had introduced him to M. Malte-Brun. What a meeting! and how much pleasure to travel with the daughter of such a man! Finally, he asked Lady Helena's permission to kiss her, to which she consented, although it was perhaps a little ""improper."" CHAPTER VIII. THE GEOGRAPHER'S RESOLUTION. Meanwhile the yacht, favored by the currents, was advancing rapidly towards the equator. In a few days the island of Madeira came in view. Glenarvan, faithful to his promise, offered to land his new guest here. ""My dear lord,"" replied Paganel, ""I will not be formal with you. Before my arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?"" ""No,"" said Glenarvan. ""Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder. Madeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and written about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of civilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the Canaries."" ""Very well, at the Canaries,"" replied Glenarvan. ""That will not take us out of our way."" ""I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three groups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have always desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by it; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this celebrated mountain."" ""As you please, my dear Paganel,"" replied Glenarvan, who could not help smiling, and with good reason. The Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two hundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the Duncan. The same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and Paganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion with lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain interrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,-- ""Mr. Paganel!"" ""My dear captain,"" replied the geographer. ""Please cast your eyes in that direction. Do you see nothing?"" ""Nothing."" ""You are not looking right. It is not on the horizon, but above, in the clouds."" ""In the clouds? I look in vain."" ""Stop, now, just on a line with the end of the bowsprit."" ""I see nothing."" ""You do not wish to see. However that may be,"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.516,"Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked them in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his children had briefly told him the story of the Duncan. [Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout.] How great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman and her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor, had not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed the feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much simplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so pure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the trials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet with a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a child who does not think of hiding his emotion. Captain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her beautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing to Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not mistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously: ""How he has grown! He is a man!"" He lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand expressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of absence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had alike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans. When Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young girl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father. Lady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain proud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young hero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord Glenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary and concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been already informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his daughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord and Lady Glenarvan, said: ""My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!"" It was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain, who confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in || added, in conclusion, ""misfortunes are sometimes beneficial, and I do not regret my error."" ""And why, my worthy friend?"" asked the major. ""Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two languages instead of one."" ""By my faith, I should not have thought of that,"" replied MacNabb. ""My compliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!"" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not, however, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the young captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign from Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at the two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed the captain, but upon a different subject. ""How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?"" he inquired. ""Excellently,"" replied the captain; ""only I must inform your lordship that we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan."" ""What!"" cried Paganel, ""you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!"" ""Hang yourself!"" said the major. ""Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my rope!"" retorted the geographer. ""Well, my dear Paganel,"" added Glenarvan, ""unless we are endowed with ubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you could not at the same time double Cape Horn."" ""Nevertheless, I am sorry,"" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated by Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,-- ""My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your noble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased with his ship."" ""Oh, how could I be?"" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps also at the young captain. ""My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,"" cried Robert, ""and I do too."" ""And I return your love, my dear boy,"" replied Captain Mangles, a little confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to the face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the captain added,-- ""Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give us a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young hero?"" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity."
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.51,"pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would have rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. ""These two ladies,"" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards them, ""hold a high rank in their country."" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed over his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a voice which he could scarcely control: ""Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed European? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?"" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said: ""That is your wife!"" ""No, mine!"" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady Helena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. ""Edward!"" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was filled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with one hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other the throng that was rushing upon the Europeans. [Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. ""Taboo! taboo!"" cried he.] At last his voice rose above the tumult. ""Taboo! taboo!"" cried he. At this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions, thus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after they were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but Robert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them. CHAPTER L. THE CHIEF'S FUNERAL. Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined the rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to persons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power to prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious hand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the offended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own insult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had || and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.517,"after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed the language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better understood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used struck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of which he knew several common words. ""Spanish?"" said he. The Patagonian nodded. ""Well,"" said the major, ""this is our friend Paganel's business. It is fortunate that he thought of learning Spanish."" Paganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a Frenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no attention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was only too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge. [Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.] ""Exactly,"" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate better, he said, in his best Spanish,-- ""You--are--a--brave--man."" The native listened, but did not answer. ""He does not understand,"" said the geographer. ""Perhaps you do not pronounce well,"" replied the major. ""Very true! Curse the pronunciation!"" And again Paganel began, but with no better success. ""I will change the expression,"" said he. And pronouncing with magisterial slowness, he uttered these words,-- ""A--Patagonian,--doubtless?"" The native remained mute as before. ""Answer!"" added Paganel. The Patagonian did not reply. ""Do--you--understand?"" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his organs of speech. It was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but in Spanish,-- ""I do not understand."" It was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his glasses, like one irritated. ""May I be hanged,"" said he, ""if I understand a word of this infernal jargon! It is certainly Araucanian."" ""No,"" replied Glenarvan; ""this man answered in Spanish."" And, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,-- ""Spanish?"" ""Yes,"" replied the native. Paganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at him quizzingly. ""Ah, my learned friend!"" said the major, while a half smile played about his lips, ""you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to you."" ""What!"" cried the geographer, starting. ""Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish."" ""He?"" [Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs.] [Sidenote: A PENINSULAR BABEL.] ""Yes. By mistake you have learnt another language, while thinking that you studied----"" MacNabb did not finish. A loud ""Oh!"" from || my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once.

Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.516,"the sailor at the helm. ""To-morrow, at sunrise, we shall know what is to be done."" At eleven o'clock the passengers and the captain retired to their cabins. At the bow the first watch was pacing the deck, while at the stern the helmsman was alone at his post. In the stillness Mary and Robert Grant came on deck. The two children, leaning upon the railing, gazed sadly at the phosphorescent sea and the luminous wake of the yacht. Mary thought of Robert's future; Robert thought of his sister's; both thought of their father. Was that beloved parent still living? Yet must they give him up? But no, what would life be without him? What would become of them without his protection? What would have become of them already, except for the magnanimity of Lord and Lady Glenarvan? The boy, taught by misfortune, divined the thoughts that were agitating his sister. He took her hand in his. ""Mary,"" said he, ""we must never despair. Remember the lessons our father taught us. 'Courage compensates for everything in this world,' he said. Let us have that indomitable courage that overcomes all obstacles. Hitherto you have labored for me, my sister, but now I shall labor for you."" ""Dear Robert!"" replied the young girl. ""I must tell you one thing,"" continued he. ""You will not be sorry, Mary?"" ""Why should I be sorry, my child?"" ""And you will let me do as I wish?"" ""What do you mean?"" asked she, anxiously. ""My sister, I shall be a sailor----!"" ""And leave me?"" cried the young girl, clasping her brother's hand. [Sidenote: EULOGY AND THRENODY.] ""Yes, sister, I shall be a sailor, like my father, and like Captain John. Mary, my dear Mary, he has not lost all hope! You will have, like me, confidence in his devotion. He has promised that he will make me a thorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together. Say that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for us it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one object, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who would never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father was!"" ""And so noble, so generous!"" added Mary. ""Do you know, Robert, that he was already one of the glories of || Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked them in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his children had briefly told him the story of the Duncan. [Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout.] How great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman and her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor, had not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed the feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much simplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so pure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the trials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet with a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a child who does not think of hiding his emotion. Captain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her beautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing to Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not mistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously: ""How he has grown! He is a man!"" He lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand expressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of absence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had alike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans. When Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young girl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father. Lady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain proud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young hero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord Glenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary and concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been already informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his daughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord and Lady Glenarvan, said: ""My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!"" It was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain, who confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.519,"bulletins of the Society, his correspondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most distinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his hand very cordially to his unexpected guest. ""And now that our introduction is over,"" added he, ""will you permit me, Monsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?"" ""Twenty, my lord,"" replied Jacques Paganel; ""it will always be a pleasure to converse with you."" ""You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?"" ""Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had engaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on board. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that a good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and not stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you."" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? ""So, Monsieur Paganel,"" said Glenarvan, ""you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?"" ""Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs."" ""Then you would not care to visit another country?"" ""No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil."" ""Ah! you have a mission?"" ""Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not || said Paganel, at last; ""and if your other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me rational."" ""What do you mean?"" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned towards the geographer. ""I mean,"" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, ""that Captain Grant is _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document leaves no doubt on this point."" ""Explain yourself, sir,"" said Miss Grant. ""Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be prisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear."" ""But that is impossible,"" replied Glenarvan. ""Impossible? And why, my noble friend?"" asked Paganel, smiling. ""Because the bottle must have been thrown when the vessel was breaking on the rocks. Hence the degrees of longitude and latitude apply to the very place of shipwreck."" ""Nothing proves it,"" said Paganel, earnestly; ""and I do not see why the shipwrecked sailors, after being carried by the Indians into the interior of the country, could not have sought to make known by means of this bottle the place of their captivity."" ""Simply, my dear Paganel, because to throw a bottle into the sea it is necessary, at least, that the sea should be before you."" ""Or, in the absence of the sea,"" added Paganel, ""the rivers which flow into it."" An astonished silence followed this unexpected, yet reasonable, answer. By the flash that brightened the eyes of his hearers Paganel knew that each of them had conceived a new hope. Lady Helena was the first to resume the conversation. ""What an idea!"" she exclaimed. ""What a _good_ idea!"" added the geographer, simply. ""Your advice then?"" asked Glenarvan. ""My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets the American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to the point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its course the survivors of the Britannia."" ""A feeble chance,"" replied the major. ""However feeble it may be,"" continued Paganel, ""we ought not to neglect it. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the current of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the prisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I will convince you beyond a doubt."" [Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!] So saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large"
Faria,Foreshadowing of Relationships,Consistent,0.51,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || heart.] ""Therefore the complicity of the guard seems to me to be proved incontestably."" The officer again made a gesture of dissent. ""Then you do not attribute the crime to the natives?"" inquired Glenarvan. ""I do not."" ""To whom, then?"" At this moment a loud uproar was heard half a mile up the river. A crowd had formed, which rapidly increased, and was now approaching the station. In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a corpse. It was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had pierced him to the heart. The assassins had dragged the body some distance from Camden Bridge, doubtless intending by this means to mislead the police in their first investigations. This discovery clearly justified the doubts of the officer. The natives had no hand in the crime. ""Those who struck the blow,"" said he, ""are persons already familiar with the use of these little instruments."" As he spoke he displayed a pair of ""darbies,"" a kind of manacles consisting of a double ring of iron, furnished with a padlock. ""Before long,"" added he, ""I shall have the pleasure of presenting them with these bracelets as a new year's gift."" ""Then you suspect----?"" ""People who have 'traveled free on Her Majesty's vessels.'"" ""What! convicts?"" cried Paganel, who recognized the phrase employed in the Australian colonies. ""I thought,"" observed Glenarvan, ""that those who have been transported had no right to stay in the province of Victoria."" ""Ah, well,"" replied the officer, ""if they have not the right, they take it! Sometimes they escape; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, these fellows have come direct from Perth. Well, they shall return again, you may be sure."" [Sidenote: A RAILROAD SLEEPER.] Mr. Mitchell nodded approvingly at the words of the officer. At this moment the cart arrived at the railroad crossing. Glenarvan, wishing to spare the ladies the spectacle at Camden Bridge, took leave of the surveyor-general, and made a sign to his companions to follow him. ""There is no occasion,"" said he, ""for us to interrupt our journey."" On reaching the cart, Glenarvan simply told Lady Helena that a railroad accident had taken place, without mentioning the part that the convicts had played in the catastrophe. He reserved this matter that he might question Ayrton in private. The little party then crossed the track, not far above the bridge, and resumed their route"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.508,"and his face bathed with fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around, and uttered a few words: ""You, my lord--my father!----"" Glenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept beside this child so miraculously saved. CHAPTER XV. THALCAVE. After the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred another, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses. However feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain from pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these well-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die. When his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the major very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from the stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This individual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and his bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his eyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians of the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with red arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned outward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of fox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his girdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted his face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with straps regularly crossed. The figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real intelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in an attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on his pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue. The major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan, who hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward; Glenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's look, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of gratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head gently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend could understand. The Patagonian, || permit him to accept this disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was on fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged the words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave silently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always confident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can have no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's annoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them, the superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another. ""A bad omen,"" said Wilson. ""Yes, in the Highlands,"" replied Mulready. ""What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,"" added Wilson, sententiously. About noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the undulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread its broad carpet of verdure before them. More than once during the journey the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the horizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near them, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that it required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character. The weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less pleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature of the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to dissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic, and the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of this region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy clouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty miles, halted on the edge of a deep ""cañada,"" an immense natural ditch filled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for tents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean streams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every depression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already deep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the horses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous swamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.511,"I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him || and Mulready, who were keeping guard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the major was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of a band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of Victoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her the number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at Seymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben Joyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a wide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster Ayrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major explained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or three almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between the quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation to pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the Duncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his care, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these facts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had transpired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of shrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near the suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile from the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays through the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the ground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. ""Here they are,"" said one. ""Yes,"" replied another, ""here is the trefoil of the hoofs again."" ""It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra."" ""All the horses are dead."" ""The poison is not far away."" ""There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This gastrolobium is a useful plant."" ""Then they were silent,"" added MacNabb, ""and departed. I wanted to know more: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning man, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with his invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of fortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned his name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees."
Kai-Koumou,,Consistent,0.506,"native language ""The Irascible."" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from the delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high rank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry between the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's influence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful tribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview, although Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. ""You are English?"" said he. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality would probably facilitate an exchange. [Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.] ""And your companions?"" asked Kai-Koumou. ""My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if you care to know, we have taken no part in the war."" ""No matter,"" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. ""Every Englishman is our enemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages."" ""They have done wrong,"" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. ""I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power."" ""Listen,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: ""Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?"" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. ""I do not know,"" said he, after a moment's silence. ""Speak,"" continued Kai-Koumou. ""Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?"" ""No,"" answered Glenarvan. ""I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people."" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. ""Then you doubt it?"" said he. ""I do not know,"" repeated Glenarvan. ""Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?"" ""Not me alone,"" replied Glenarvan; ""but perhaps all of us."" ""Among the Maoris,"" said Kai-Koumou, ""it is one for one."" ""Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,"" answered Glenarvan, || and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: ""Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!"" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. ""They have gathered around the chief,"" said he, in a low voice. ""They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak."" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: ""Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen."" ""This chief,"" said the major, ""has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?"" ""Yes, they are listening to him,"" continued Robert. ""They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification."" ""Is it really so?"" cried the major. ""Yes, Mr. MacNabb,"" replied Robert. ""Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!"" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] ""Get down, Robert,"" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. ""Edward,"" said she, in a firm voice, ""neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!"" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. ""A weapon!"" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. ""Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them."" ""Glenarvan,"" said MacNabb quickly, ""hide the revolver. It is not time yet."" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the"
Noirtier,Resolution of Original Issues,Consistent,0.508,"meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?"" ""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every balcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and Concepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and children. Glenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this decline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and, without losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R. Bentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual received him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain Grant undertook to search along the entire coast. The question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of Chili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an event had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts of the country. But Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and, sparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast, but their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the people of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude that the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck. [Illustration: In Concepcion.] [Sidenote: ""TRY AGAIN!""] Glenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors. Mary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now six days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers were together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her words--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children of the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and was regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from it new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan, addressing him, said,-- ""Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made of this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?"" Paganel did not answer. He was reflecting. ""Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?"" continued Glenarvan. ""Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the mind?"" Paganel was still silent. ""In short,"" said Glenarvan, ""does not the word _Indian_ justify us still more?"" ""Perfectly,"" replied MacNabb. ""And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they wrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?"" ""There you are wrong, my dear lord,"""
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.514,"in a railroad car, would it stop for him?"" ""No; but he could get out at the first station,"" answered Lady Helena. ""Well,"" said Glenarvan, ""he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first landing."" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after convincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating those fatal words: ""The Duncan! the Duncan!"" He could find no others in his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the yacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he returned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration] ""And this Duncan is going----?"" he asked. ""To America, Monsieur Paganel."" ""And where especially?"" ""To Concepcion."" ""To Chili! to Chili!"" cried the unfortunate geographer. ""And my mission to India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the Central Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the Society?"" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] ""Come, monsieur,"" said Glenarvan, ""do not despair. Everything can be arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little consequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains of Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a vessel to take you back to Europe."" ""I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an extraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And my cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?"" ""Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present."" ""But,"" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, ""the Duncan is a pleasure yacht."" ""Yes, sir,"" replied Captain Mangles, ""and belongs to his lordship, Lord Glenarvan----"" ""Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,"" said Glenarvan. ""A thousand thanks, my lord,"" replied Paganel; ""I am truly sensible to your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a beautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These ladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs only to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to Calcutta as Concepcion. Now, since this is a pleasure voyage----"" The negative reception that met Paganel's proposal did not permit him to develop it. He paused. ""Monsieur Paganel,"" said Lady Helena at length, ""if this were || loved, his dear Helena, Mary Grant, and the crew of the Duncan. He wandered along the barren coast which the waves covered with phosphorescent bubbles. He looked, he listened, and even thought that he saw a fitful light on the sea. ""I am not mistaken,"" he soliloquized; ""I saw a ship's light, the Duncan's. Ah! why cannot my eyes pierce the darkness?"" [Illustration: Glenarvan watched alone. He could not convince himself that the Duncan was so near him; but as for supposing that she had not arrived at her appointed rendezvous, it was impossible, for such a ship there were no delays.] Then an idea occurred to him. Paganel called himself a nyctalops; he could see in the night. The geographer was sleeping like a mole in his bed, when a strong hand dragged him from his sandy couch. ""Who is that?"" cried he. ""I."" ""Who?"" ""Glenarvan. Come, I need your eyes."" ""My eyes?"" replied Paganel, rubbing them vigorously. ""Yes, your eyes, to distinguish the Duncan in this darkness. Come."" ""And why my eyes?"" said Paganel to himself, delighted, nevertheless, to be of service to Glenarvan. He rose, shaking his torpid limbs in the manner of one awakened from sleep, and followed his friend along the shore. Glenarvan requested him to survey the dark horizon to seaward. For several moments Paganel conscientiously devoted himself to this task. ""Well, do you perceive nothing?"" asked Glenarvan. ""Nothing. Not even a cat could see two paces before her."" ""Look for a red or a green light, on the starboard or the larboard side."" ""I see neither a red nor a green light. All is darkness,"" replied Paganel, whose eyes were thereupon involuntarily closed. For half an hour he mechanically followed his impatient friend in absolute silence, with his head bowed upon his breast, sometimes raising it suddenly. He tottered along with uncertain steps, like those of a drunken man. At last Glenarvan, seeing that the geographer was in a state of somnambulism, took him by the arm, and, without waking him, led him back to his sand-hole, and comfortably deposited him therein. At break of day they were all started to their feet by the cry,-- [Sidenote: IMPATIENCE.] ""The Duncan! the Duncan!"" ""Hurrah! hurrah!"" replied Glenarvan's companions, rushing to the shore. The Duncan was indeed in sight. Five miles distant, the yacht was sailing under low pressure, her main-sails carefully reefed, while her"
Faria,Life in Captivity Before Château d'If,Consistent,0.51,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || and her brother rose at daybreak, and were walking in the galleries and water terraces of the castle, when the sound of a coach was heard in the great court-yard. It was Lord Glenarvan returning to Malcolm Castle at the full speed of his horses. Almost immediately Lady Helena, accompanied by the major, appeared in the court-yard, and flew to meet her husband. But he seemed sad, disappointed, and angry. He clasped his wife in his arms, and was silent. [Illustration] ""Well, Edward!"" she exclaimed. ""Well, my dear Helena,"" he replied, ""those people have no hearts!"" ""They refused?"" ""Yes, they refused me a vessel: they spoke of the millions vainly spent in searching for Franklin; they declared the document was vague and unintelligible; they said that the shipwreck of these unfortunates had happened two years ago, and that there was little chance of finding them. They maintained too, that, if prisoners of the Indians, they must have been carried into the interior of the country; that they could not ransack all Patagonia to find three men,--three Scotchmen; the search would be vain and perilous, and would cost the lives of more men than it would save. In short, they gave all the absurd reasons of people who mean to refuse. They remembered the captain's projects, and I fear that the unfortunate man is forever lost!"" ""My father, my poor father!"" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan. ""Your father! What, Miss----?"" said he, surprised at seeing a young girl at his feet. ""Yes, Edward, Miss Grant and her brother,"" replied Lady Helena; ""the two children of Captain Grant, who have thus been condemned to remain orphans."" ""Ah, miss!"" answered Lord Glenarvan, ""if I had known of your presence----"" He said no more. A painful silence, interrupted only by sobs, reigned in the court-yard. No one raised his voice, neither Lord Glenarvan, Lady Helena, the major, nor the servants of the castle, who were standing about even at this early hour. But by their attitude they all protested against the conduct of the officials. After several moments the major resumed the conversation, and, addressing Lord Glenarvan, said,-- ""Then you have no more hope?"" ""None."" ""Well,"" cried young Robert, ""I will go to these people, and--we shall see----"" He did not finish his threat, for his sister stopped him; but his clinched hands indicated his intentions. ""No, Robert,"""
Noirtier,Political Intrigue and Personal Ambition,Consistent,0.508,"meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?"" ""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every balcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and Concepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and children. Glenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this decline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and, without losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R. Bentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual received him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain Grant undertook to search along the entire coast. The question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of Chili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an event had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts of the country. But Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and, sparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast, but their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the people of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude that the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck. [Illustration: In Concepcion.] [Sidenote: ""TRY AGAIN!""] Glenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors. Mary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now six days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers were together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her words--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children of the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and was regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from it new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan, addressing him, said,-- ""Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made of this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?"" Paganel did not answer. He was reflecting. ""Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?"" continued Glenarvan. ""Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the mind?"" Paganel was still silent. ""In short,"" said Glenarvan, ""does not the word _Indian_ justify us still more?"" ""Perfectly,"" replied MacNabb. ""And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they wrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?"" ""There you are wrong, my dear lord,"""
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.504,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion.

""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave.

He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around, and uttered a few words: ""You, my lord--my father!----"" Glenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept beside this child so miraculously saved. CHAPTER XV. THALCAVE. After the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred another, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses. However feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain from pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these well-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die. When his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the major very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from the stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This individual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and his bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his eyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians of the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with red arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned outward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of fox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his girdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted his face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with straps regularly crossed. The figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real intelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in an attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on his pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue. The major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan, who hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward; Glenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's look, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of gratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head gently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend could understand. The Patagonian,"
Noirtier,Political Intrigue and Personal Ambition,Consistent,0.505,"meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?""

""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome!

Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them.

The quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors. ""This villain might have been a great man,"" observed the major. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan. ""He has a strong and self-reliant character. Why must his abilities be devoted to crime?"" ""But Harry Grant?"" ""I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them where their father is?"" ""I!"" cried Paganel. As we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and excitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He had listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered was worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once. ""You, Paganel!"" he exclaimed; ""do you know where Captain Grant is?"" ""As well as can be known,"" answered the geographer. ""And how do you know?"" ""By that everlasting document."" [Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.] ""Ah!"" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity. ""Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did not speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it was useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion corroborates mine."" ""Then New Zealand----?"" asked Glenarvan. ""Hear and judge,"" replied Paganel. ""I did not commit the blunder that saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter at Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain. You remember that we were in the cart. MacNabb had just told Lady Helena the story of the convicts, and had handed her the copy of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that gave an account of the accident at Camden Bridge. As I was writing, the paper lay on the ground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen, and these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind! 'Aland' was one of the very words in the English document,--a word that we had hitherto translated _ashore_, but which was the termination of the proper name Zealand."" ""Ha!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Yes,"" continued Paganel, with profound conviction, ""this interpretation had escaped me, and do you know why? Because my examinations were naturally confined more particularly to the French document, where this important"
Faria,The Origin of Political Intrigue,Consistent,0.504,"formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer. ""But we are none the less without an interpreter,"" said the major. ""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of || the order to cruise along the shore, when he suddenly ceased rowing. He had observed three canoes starting from Lottin Point, with the evident intention of overtaking and capturing the unfortunate fugitives. ""To sea! to sea!"" cried he; ""better perish in the waves than be captured!"" The canoe, under the strokes of its four oarsmen, at once put to sea, and for some time kept its distance. But the strength of the weakened fugitives soon grew less, and their pursuers gradually gained upon them. The boats were now scarcely a mile apart. There was therefore no possibility of avoiding the attack of the natives, who, armed with their long guns, were already preparing to fire. [Sidenote: DEATH ON EVERY HAND.] What was Glenarvan doing? Standing at the stern of the canoe, he looked around as if for some expected aid. What did he expect? What did he wish? Had he a presentiment? All at once his face brightened, his hand was stretched towards an indistinct object. ""A ship!"" cried he; ""my friends, a ship! Row, row!"" Not one of the four oarsmen turned to see this unexpected vessel, for they must not lose a stroke. Only Paganel, rising, directed his telescope towards the place indicated. ""Yes,"" said he, ""a ship, a steamer, under full headway, coming towards us! Courage, captain!"" The fugitives displayed new energy, and for several moments longer they kept their distance. The steamer grew more and more distinct. They could clearly discern her masts, and the thick clouds of black smoke that issued from her smoke-stack. Glenarvan, giving the helm to Robert, had seized the geographer's glass, and did not lose a single movement of the vessel. But what were Captain Mangles and his companions to think when they saw the expression of his features change, his face grow pale, and the instrument fall from his hands. A single word explained this sudden emotion. ""The Duncan!"" cried Glenarvan,--""the Duncan and the convicts!"" ""The Duncan?"" repeated the captain, dropping his oar and rising. ""Yes, death on all sides!"" moaned Glenarvan, overcome by so many calamities. It was indeed the yacht--without a doubt,--the yacht, with her crew of bandits! The major could not repress a malediction. This was too much. Meantime the canoe was floating at random. Whither should they guide it, whither flee? Was it possible to choose between the savages and the convicts? [Illustration: A second ball"
Faria,The Formation of Spiritual Traits,Consistent,0.509,"the foot of the mound, beating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate victim rose; but a violent blow with the ""méré,"" a formidable club, wielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the captives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for the funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies lay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could not alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of Nouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and mistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced to slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the severest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed, and compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to the Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude for eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished at a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all bonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this death was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were reserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the victims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible details. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide this awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now understood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel tortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with horror. The funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an indigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer human. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw themselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at their frenzy? [Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible details.] [Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in || Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert, of the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less fortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris, who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance, who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief spoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how matters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was ""Hihy"" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The spectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he attached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by strong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly treated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he was a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture, his condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate friends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and escaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief, knew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain, and that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take refuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were held captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's tomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his friends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance of his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led them to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous congratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the present. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they did not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst would force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time, and the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the difficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which Providence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend it,"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.529,"""To know what countries the thirty-seventh parallel crosses."" ""Nothing easier,"" replied Paganel; ""I need not even disturb myself to tell you.""

""It cuts Australia across the province of Victoria."" ""Proceed."" ""Leaving Australia----"" This last sentence was not finished. Did the geographer hesitate? Did he know no more? No; but a startling cry was heard in the top of the tree. Glenarvan and his friends grew pale as they gazed at each other. Had a new calamity happened? Had the unfortunate Paganel fallen? Already Wilson and Mulready were hastening to his assistance, when a long body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands could grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead? They did not know; but he was about to fall into the roaring waters, when the major, with a strong hand, arrested his progress. ""Very much obliged, MacNabb!"" cried Paganel. ""Why, what is the matter with you?"" said the major. [Illustration: A long body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands could grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead?] ""What has got into you? Is this another of your eternal distractions?"" ""Yes, yes,"" replied Paganel, in a voice choked with emotion (and leaves). ""Yes, a distraction,--phenomenal this time."" ""What is it?"" ""We have been mistaken! We are still mistaken!"" ""Explain yourself."" ""Glenarvan, major, Robert, my friends,"" cried Paganel, ""all you who hear me, we are seeking Captain Grant where he is not."" ""What do you say?"" cried Glenarvan. ""Not only where he is not,"" added Paganel, ""but even where he has never been."" CHAPTER XXIV. PAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE. A profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the geographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with such conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This declaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former had asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture, indicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master of his emotion, resumed. ""Yes,"" said he, in a tone of conviction, ""yes, we have gone astray in our search, and have || kept your word, and I will keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall be abandoned."" ""Oh, it matters little to me,"" answered Ayrton. ""Return to your cabin now, and await our decision."" The quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors. ""This villain might have been a great man,"" observed the major. ""Yes,"" replied Glenarvan. ""He has a strong and self-reliant character. Why must his abilities be devoted to crime?"" ""But Harry Grant?"" ""I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them where their father is?"" ""I!"" cried Paganel. As we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and excitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He had listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered was worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once. ""You, Paganel!"" he exclaimed; ""do you know where Captain Grant is?"" ""As well as can be known,"" answered the geographer. ""And how do you know?"" ""By that everlasting document."" [Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.] ""Ah!"" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity. ""Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did not speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it was useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion corroborates mine."" ""Then New Zealand----?"" asked Glenarvan. ""Hear and judge,"" replied Paganel. ""I did not commit the blunder that saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter at Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain. You remember that we were in the cart. MacNabb had just told Lady Helena the story of the convicts, and had handed her the copy of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that gave an account of the accident at Camden Bridge. As I was writing, the paper lay on the ground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen, and these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind! 'Aland' was one of the very words in the English document,--a word that we had hitherto translated _ashore_, but which was the termination of the proper name Zealand."" ""Ha!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Yes,"" continued Paganel, with profound conviction, ""this interpretation had escaped me, and do you know why? Because my examinations were naturally confined more particularly to the French document, where this important"
Faria,The Formation of Spiritual Traits,Consistent,0.509,"without a murmur, while birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles reposed after the fatigues of the day. The silence of the desert reigned on the vast expanse of the Pampas. Glenarvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and, stretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing sleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground: Thaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in repose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his master. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the embers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last rays over the silent obscurity. About ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes became fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a listening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect some scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed on his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling Indians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable beasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last possibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid glance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his anxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be consumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals. According to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress of events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands, his elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man whom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep. An hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward silence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have suspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of the Indian foresaw the coming danger. While he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His nose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian suddenly started. ""Thaouka has scented some enemy,"" said he. He arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but not tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among the tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which spread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You would have thought fantastic elves were || repeated Paganel; ""does such a thing exist? Moreover, what is the question? A journey of scarcely three hundred and fifty leagues, since we shall proceed in a straight line; a journey which will be accomplished in a favorable latitude and climate; in short, a journey whose duration will be only a month at most. It is a mere walk."" ""Monsieur Paganel,"" asked Lady Helena at last, ""do you think that, if the shipwrecked sailors have fallen into the power of the Indians, their lives have been spared?"" ""Certainly I do, madam. The Indians are not cannibals; far from that, one of my countrymen whom I knew in the Society was three years prisoner among the Indians of the Pampas. He suffered, was ill-treated, but at last gained the victory in this trying ordeal. A European is a useful person in these countries. The Indians know his value, and esteem him very highly."" ""Well then, there is no more hesitation,"" said Glenarvan; ""we must start, and that, too, without delay. What course shall we take?"" ""An easy and agreeable one,"" replied Paganel. ""A few mountains to begin with; then a gentle descent on the eastern slope of the Andes; and at last a level, grassy, sandy plain, a real garden."" ""Let us see the map,"" said the major. ""Here it is, my dear MacNabb. We shall begin at the end of the thirty-seventh parallel on the coast of Chili. After passing through the capital of Araucania, we shall strike the Cordilleras, and descending their steep declivities across the Rio Colorado, we shall reach the Pampas. Passing the frontiers of Buenos Ayres, we shall continue our search until we reach the shores of the Atlantic."" [Sidenote: A STROLL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.] Thus speaking and developing the programme of the expedition, Paganel did not even take the trouble to look at the map spread before him. And he had no need to; educated in the schools of Frézier, Molina, Humboldt, and Miers, his unerring memory could neither be deceived nor baffled. After finishing his plan, he added: ""Therefore, my dear friends, the course is straight. In thirty days we shall accomplish it, and arrive before the Duncan on the eastern shore, since the westerly winds will delay her progress."" ""The Duncan then,"" said Captain Mangles, ""will cross the thirty-seventh parallel between Cape Corrientes and Cape St. Antonio?"" ""Exactly."" ""And whom would you constitute"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.509,"he added,-- ""I saved my contract from the wreck."" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said: ""My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the two months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find with him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true man, and worthy of your entire confidence."" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's honesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a paper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose writing Mary recognized immediately. It stated that ""Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow."" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity, for it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be in his hands and not belong to him. [Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.] ""Now,"" said Glenarvan, ""I appeal to you all for advice as to what is best to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us."" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: ""I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----"" ""Certainly,"" replied Glenarvan. ""I think, like you,"" continued Ayrton, ""that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives."" ""You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,"" said Paganel. ""The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?"" ""It is quite likely, sir,"" replied Ayrton. ""The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces."" ""This fact will complicate our search,"" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. ""How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the || I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him"
Noirtier,Completing Character Relationships,Consistent,0.502,"added the young girl, covering her brother's face with kisses; ""and all that they will like, too!"" Then, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed silently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy they still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea rocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in the darkness. But now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The brother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that mysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the same instant the same curious hallucination. [Sidenote: ""METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!""] From the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves, they thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred every fibre of their hearts. ""Help! help!"" cried the voice. ""Mary,"" said Robert, ""did you hear?"" And, raising their heads above the bulwarks, they both gazed searchingly into the misty shadows of the night. Yet there was nothing but the darkness stretching blankly before them. ""Robert,"" said Mary, pale with emotion, ""I thought--yes, I thought like you."" At this moment another cry reached them, and this time the illusion was such that these words broke simultaneously from both their hearts: ""My father! my father!"" This was too much for Mary Grant. Overcome by emotion, she sank senseless into her brother's arms. ""Help!"" cried Robert. ""My sister! my father! help!"" The man at the helm hastened to Miss Grant's assistance, and after him the sailors of the watch, Captain Mangles, Lady Helena, and Lord Glenarvan, who had been suddenly awakened. ""My sister is dying, and my father is yonder!"" exclaimed Robert, pointing to the waves. No one understood his words. ""Yes,"" repeated he, ""my father is yonder! I heard his voice, and Mary did too!"" Just then Mary Grant recovered consciousness, and, looking wildly around, cried: ""My father, my father is yonder!"" The unfortunate girl arose, and, leaning over the bulwark, would have thrown herself into the sea. ""My lord! Madam!"" repeated she, clasping her hands, ""I tell you my father is there! I declare to you that I heard his voice issue from the waves like a despairing wail, like a last adieu!"" [Sidenote: THE POSITIVENESS OF DISBELIEF.] Then her feelings overcame the poor girl, and she became insensible. They carried her to her cabin, and Lady Helena followed, to minister to her wants, || meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- ""A Frenchman?"" ""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.509,"I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments.""

A poisonous plant enabled him || search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to this vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad state of exhaustion and feebleness! However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger and thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in these waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working had God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that were hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know which to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord Glenarvan, and reply to him. ""But the convicts?"" inquired Glenarvan. ""What have you done with the convicts?"" ""The convicts!"" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to understand a question. ""Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht."" ""What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?"" ""Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?"" ""I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him."" ""Never?"" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor. ""Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New Zealand?"" [Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!] Although Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's astonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice: ""The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders."" ""By my orders?"" cried Glenarvan. ""Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your letter."" ""My letter?"" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in eager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the Duncan. ""Well,"" continued Glenarvan, ""let us have an explanation; for I almost think I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?"" ""Yes; a letter from your lordship."" ""At Melbourne?"" ""At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship."" ""And this letter?"" ""It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord."" ""Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce."" ""No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia."" ""Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the letter say?"" ""It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the eastern shores of----"""
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.515,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || ""To eat reasonably of this,"" said Paganel, ""would be ingratitude towards Providence. We really must eat immoderately."" And he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water of the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties. [Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.] At ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The water-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly revived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost continuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which separates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped to meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find Harry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery. Since they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great satisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the cold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither man nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from dryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence. But, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely uninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, ""disinhabited."" Frequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose banks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious larks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These pretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings that strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red breasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like hammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes, marching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind. Their nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in the shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled at the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's calculations. ""I have been curious for a long time,"" said he to the major, ""to see a flamingo fly."" ""Well,"" said MacNabb. ""Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it."" ""Do so, Paganel."" ""Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses."" And Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the flock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major. Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly destroy even"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.517,"Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert, of the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less fortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris, who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance, who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief spoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how matters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was ""Hihy"" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The spectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he attached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by strong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly treated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he was a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture, his condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate friends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and escaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief, knew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain, and that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take refuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were held captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's tomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his friends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance of his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led them to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous congratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the present. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they did not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst would force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time, and the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the difficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which Providence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend it, || Then all, eager to know Paganel's new project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the geographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. ""My friends,"" said he, ""my project has this advantage, that if it does not produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will not be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed."" ""And this project?"" asked the major. ""This is it,"" replied Paganel. ""The superstition of the natives has made this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help us to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become the victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon us, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he will abandon the mountain and return to his village?"" ""Probably,"" said Glenarvan. ""And with what horrible death do you threaten us?"" inquired Lady Helena. ""The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,"" continued Paganel. ""The avenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them."" ""What! you would make a volcano?"" cried Captain Mangles. ""Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only ask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own advantage."" ""The idea is good,"" said the major, ""and well conceived, Paganel."" ""You understand,"" resumed the geographer, ""that we are to feign being consumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the tomb of Kara-Tété."" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] ""Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till the savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege."" ""But if they think of making sure of our destruction,"" said Miss Grant, ""and climb the mountain?"" ""No, my dear Mary,"" replied Paganel, ""they will not do that. The mountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the taboo will be still more rigorous."" ""This plan is really well conceived,"" remarked Glenarvan. ""There is only one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist in remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail us. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part skillfully."" ""And when shall we make this last venture?"" asked Lady Helena. ""This very evening,"" answered"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.512,"on board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of sympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after this recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real interest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that Captain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From the fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other. Ayrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and simply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was carried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led a very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but he was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery. However, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He watched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight would plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night in October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge in the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots, edible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair, he wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by day and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers, mountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few travelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. ""And if Ayrton is pleased with me,"" said the Irish colonist, when the story was finished, ""I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest and intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house shall long be at his service."" Ayrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He probably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers ought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated a hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the conversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from Ayrton, when the major, addressing him, said: ""You were quartermaster of the Britannia?"" ""Yes,"" replied Ayrton. But perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however slight, had suggested this inquiry, || I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes."" ""But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen his name and contract?"" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this matter. ""These,"" replied he, in his calm voice, ""are the proofs that can be derived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's real name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain that he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the Britannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given by Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the convicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray by vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a sailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts."" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. ""Now,"" replied Glenarvan, ""will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's quartermaster is in Australia?"" ""How, I do not know,"" said MacNabb; ""and the police declare they know no more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to say. Here is a mystery that the future will explain."" ""The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,"" said Captain Mangles. ""You are right, John,"" replied the major; ""and such information would be likely to facilitate their search."" ""This unfortunate, then,"" remarked Lady Helena, ""intruded into O'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?"" ""There is no doubt of it,"" continued MacNabb. ""He was meditating some hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was offered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the shipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in the expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends, the farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of our course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him"
Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.51,"repay the disinterested generosity of the brave guide; but at last a happy idea occurred to him. He drew from his pocket-book a costly medallion inclosing an admirable portrait, one of Lawrence's master-pieces, and presented it to Thalcave. ""My wife,"" said Glenarvan. Thalcave gazed with wonder at the portrait, and pronounced these simple words,-- ""Good and beautiful!"" Then Robert, Paganel, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors bade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each one in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at parting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him to accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the Indian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's most precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but caresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka. [Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves.] At that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the narrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach. ""My wife?"" asked Glenarvan. ""My sister?"" cried Robert. ""Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,"" replied the cockswain. ""But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning to ebb."" The last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his friends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian took him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly. ""Now go,"" said he; ""you are a man!"" ""Adieu, my friend, adieu!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Shall we ever see each other again?"" asked Paganel. ""Who knows?"" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven. They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct, and soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan. Robert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself upon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with their joyous shouts. Thus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America on a rigorously straight line. || pressed his lips to the boy's cheeks, which were still wet with tears. They then spoke of the generous Thalcave. Lady Helena regretted that she could not have shaken hands with the brave Indian. MacNabb, after the first outbursts of enthusiasm, repaired to his cabin to shave himself. As for Paganel, he flitted hither and thither, like a bee, extracting the honey of compliments and smiles. He wished to embrace all on board the Duncan, and, beginning with Lady Helena and Mary Grant, ended with Mr. Olbinett, the steward, who could not better recognize such politeness than by announcing breakfast. ""Breakfast!"" cried Paganel. ""Yes, Mr. Paganel,"" replied Olbinett. ""A real breakfast, on a real table, with table-cloth and napkins?"" ""Certainly."" ""And shall we not eat hard eggs, or ostrich steaks?"" ""Oh, Mr. Paganel!"" replied the worthy steward, greatly embarrassed. ""I did not mean to offend you, my friend,"" said the geographer; ""but for a month our food has been of that sort, and we have dined, not at a table, but stretched on the ground, except when we were astride of the trees. This breakfast that you have just announced seemed to me, therefore, like a dream, a fiction, a chimera."" ""Well, we will test its reality, Monsieur Paganel,"" replied Lady Helena, who could not help laughing. ""Accept my arm,"" said the gallant geographer. ""Has your lordship any orders to give?"" inquired Captain Mangles. ""After breakfast, my dear fellow,"" replied Glenarvan, ""we will discuss in council the programme of the new expedition."" The passengers and the young captain then descended to the cabin. Orders were given to the engineer to keep up steam, that they might start at the first signal. The major and the travelers, after a rapid toilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to Mr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior to the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every dish, ""through absent-mindedness,"" as he said. This unfortunate word led Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally shown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each other with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised ""upon his honor"" not to commit a single blunder during the entire voyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in the study of Spanish. ""After all,"" he"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.514,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || He told, word for word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage of the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by the condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves, the boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation, their refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators, the water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these incidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror of his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert the caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly praised, or by more enthusiastic friends. ""Now, my friends,"" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his recital, ""let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of Captain Grant."" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's state-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and charts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the shipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or the Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly interpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a sudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had been following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to explain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every one. When he had finished his demonstration, Glenarvan announced that the Duncan would immediately set sail for Australia. The major, however, before the order was given, asked permission to make a single remark. ""Speak, major,"" said Glenarvan. ""My object,"" said MacNabb, ""is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them. I consider them rational, sagacious, and worthy of our whole attention. But I desire to submit them to a final examination, that their validity may be incontestable."" [Illustration: ""My object,"" said MacNabb, ""is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them.""] No one knew what the prudent MacNabb meant, and his hearers listened with some anxiety. ""Go on, major,"" said Paganel: ""I am ready to answer all your questions."" ""Nothing can be simpler,"" said the major. ""Five months ago, in the Frith of Clyde, when we studied the three documents, their interpretation seemed clear to us. No place but the western coast of Patagonia could, we"
Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,,Consistent,0.504,"search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to this vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad state of exhaustion and feebleness! However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger and thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in these waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working had God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that were hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know which to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord Glenarvan, and reply to him. ""But the convicts?"" inquired Glenarvan. ""What have you done with the convicts?"" ""The convicts!"" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to understand a question. ""Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht."" ""What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?"" ""Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?"" ""I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him."" ""Never?"" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor. ""Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New Zealand?"" [Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!] Although Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's astonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice: ""The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders."" ""By my orders?"" cried Glenarvan. ""Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your letter."" ""My letter?"" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in eager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the Duncan. ""Well,"" continued Glenarvan, ""let us have an explanation; for I almost think I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?"" ""Yes; a letter from your lordship."" ""At Melbourne?"" ""At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship."" ""And this letter?"" ""It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord."" ""Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce."" ""No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia."" ""Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the letter say?"" ""It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the eastern shores of----"" || I knew what I wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all the convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's arguments."" ""Then,"" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, ""Ayrton has brought us here to rob and assassinate us?"" ""Yes,"" replied the major. ""And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us, waiting for a favorable opportunity?"" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] ""Yes.""

Jacques Paganel,,Consistent,0.52,"Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked them in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his children had briefly told him the story of the Duncan. [Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout.] How great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman and her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor, had not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed the feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much simplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so pure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the trials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet with a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a child who does not think of hiding his emotion. Captain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her beautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing to Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not mistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously: ""How he has grown! He is a man!"" He lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand expressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of absence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had alike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans. When Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young girl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father. Lady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain proud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young hero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord Glenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary and concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been already informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his daughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord and Lady Glenarvan, said: ""My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!"" It was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain, who confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in || Then all, eager to know Paganel's new project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the geographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. ""My friends,"" said he, ""my project has this advantage, that if it does not produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will not be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed."" ""And this project?"" asked the major. ""This is it,"" replied Paganel. ""The superstition of the natives has made this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help us to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become the victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon us, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he will abandon the mountain and return to his village?"" ""Probably,"" said Glenarvan. ""And with what horrible death do you threaten us?"" inquired Lady Helena. ""The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,"" continued Paganel. ""The avenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them."" ""What! you would make a volcano?"" cried Captain Mangles. ""Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only ask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own advantage."" ""The idea is good,"" said the major, ""and well conceived, Paganel."" ""You understand,"" resumed the geographer, ""that we are to feign being consumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the tomb of Kara-Tété."" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] ""Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till the savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege."" ""But if they think of making sure of our destruction,"" said Miss Grant, ""and climb the mountain?"" ""No, my dear Mary,"" replied Paganel, ""they will not do that. The mountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the taboo will be still more rigorous."" ""This plan is really well conceived,"" remarked Glenarvan. ""There is only one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist in remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail us. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part skillfully."" ""And when shall we make this last venture?"" asked Lady Helena. ""This very evening,"" answered"
Noirtier,A Double Life in the Napoleonic Era,Consistent,0.515,"Britannia was lost forever, and her father dead! We must not, therefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the _Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her despair. It was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken. Even if she should learn that her father's dead body had been found on a desert coast, or in the hull of a shipwrecked vessel, it was better than this continual doubt, this eternal torment of uncertainty. She told her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth Railroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after so many harassing thoughts, began to hope. Such was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady Glenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all those long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic daughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without hiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain Grant. As for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time: for he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister; comprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last, encircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain the cry that came from the very depths of his heart,-- ""Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!"" [Illustration: ""My father, my poor father!"" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.] Night had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of the two children, would not longer continue the conversation. Mary and Robert were conducted to their chambers, and fell asleep dreaming of a brighter future. After they had retired, Lady Helena saw the major, and told him all the events of the day. ""That Mary Grant is a brave girl,"" said MacNabb, when he had heard his cousin's story. ""May Heaven grant my husband success in his enterprise!"" replied Lady Helena; ""for the situation of the two children would be terrible!"" ""He will succeed,"" answered MacNabb, ""or the hearts of the authorities must be harder than the stone of Portland."" In spite of the major's assurance, Lady Helena passed the night in the greatest anxiety, and could scarce gain an hour's repose. [Sidenote: ""BROKEN CISTERNS.""] The next morning Mary || activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every balcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and Concepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and children. Glenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this decline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and, without losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R. Bentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual received him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain Grant undertook to search along the entire coast. The question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of Chili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an event had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts of the country. But Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and, sparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast, but their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the people of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude that the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck. [Illustration: In Concepcion.] [Sidenote: ""TRY AGAIN!""] Glenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors. Mary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now six days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers were together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her words--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children of the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and was regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from it new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan, addressing him, said,-- ""Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made of this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?"" Paganel did not answer. He was reflecting. ""Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?"" continued Glenarvan. ""Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the mind?"" Paganel was still silent. ""In short,"" said Glenarvan, ""does not the word _Indian_ justify us still more?"" ""Perfectly,"" replied MacNabb. ""And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they wrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?"" ""There you are wrong, my dear lord,"""

""Yes, a Frenchman,"" replied Paganel. ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. ""One of your friends?"" asked the major of Paganel. ""Yes,"" replied he, with national pride; ""we have friends in all parts of the world!"" [Illustration: ""Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,"" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. ""You have seen them?"" said he. ""Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!"" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. ""He will do!"" added the sergeant. ""He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!"" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to || said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied the other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot for that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I have none!'"" [Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage.] CHAPTER XXV. BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER. Jacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly applauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer obtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody. However, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage. During the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a good sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The inmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden changes of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which had been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the example; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased their melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the recesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them. But before ""retiring to their nest,"" as Paganel said, Glenarvan, Robert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last time the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just set in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part of the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations, usually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could be distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's benefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant. [Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.] While the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon assumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined, gradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of threatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky. Its motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not a breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled the surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some huge pneumatic"
Faria,Addendum to Character Relationships,Consistent,0.512,"formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer. ""But we are none the less without an interpreter,"" said the major. ""Oh, do not be troubled,"" replied Paganel. ""The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well."" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian ""the thunderer."" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should be passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained to be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were both wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was accustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and was one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to furnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take him to a ""tolderia"" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant, where they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This proposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which Paganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and his learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the stream under the guidance of || repay the disinterested generosity of the brave guide; but at last a happy idea occurred to him. He drew from his pocket-book a costly medallion inclosing an admirable portrait, one of Lawrence's master-pieces, and presented it to Thalcave. ""My wife,"" said Glenarvan. Thalcave gazed with wonder at the portrait, and pronounced these simple words,-- ""Good and beautiful!"" Then Robert, Paganel, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors bade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each one in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at parting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him to accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the Indian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's most precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but caresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka. [Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves.] At that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the narrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach. ""My wife?"" asked Glenarvan. ""My sister?"" cried Robert. ""Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,"" replied the cockswain. ""But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning to ebb."" The last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his friends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian took him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly. ""Now go,"" said he; ""you are a man!"" ""Adieu, my friend, adieu!"" cried Glenarvan. ""Shall we ever see each other again?"" asked Paganel. ""Who knows?"" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven. They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct, and soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan. Robert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself upon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with their joyous shouts. Thus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America on a rigorously straight line."
Faria,The Answer to a Lingering Question,Consistent,0.507,"rain. He discovered the wound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his right side. MacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital parts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth, while the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had been seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening of the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of tinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus succeeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his side, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing draught. At the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been motionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips murmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard him say: ""My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----"" [Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.] The major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did Mulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not simply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This letter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed to Tom Austin was gone. The night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that the wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was patient better nursed, or by more tender hands. Day appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along the vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of branches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the sides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper. Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration around the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but found no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where the attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot by Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had mortified, was a horrible sight. Glenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence forbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the seriousness of || natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and find water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute of the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was therefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they did not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one could entirely allay his thirst. At evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one relied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of the day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of mosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed. If the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty annoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the matter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted the absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of their bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in a very bad humor. However, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it was important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were very much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their riders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of water had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and the heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the Pampas. [Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!] During the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready, who rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of Indians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought of the information that these natives might furnish concerning the shipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely enjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains. He considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid them. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and made ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any emergency. The Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten men, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a hundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high foreheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their olive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They"
Thalcave,,Consistent,0.508,"my father,' in Spanish?"" he asked. ""_Es mio padre_,"" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- ""_Es mio padre!_"" ""_Suo padre!_"" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. ""But where was he last?"" asked Paganel. ""With the cazique Calfoucoura,"" answered Thalcave. ""On the line we have been following?"" ""Yes."" ""And who is this cazique?"" ""The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts."" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] ""That is to say, false in word and in deed,"" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. ""And can we rescue our friend?"" he added. ""Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians."" ""And when did you hear of him?"" ""A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky."" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. ""You speak of a prisoner,"" said Paganel; ""but were there not three?"" ""I do not know,"" replied Thalcave. ""And you know nothing of their actual situation?"" ""Nothing."" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe ""geographically"" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to || were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of war and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration] Having halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and gesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded two yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with incredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never have overtaken them. ""The cowards!"" cried Paganel. ""They fly too fast for honest men,"" said MacNabb. ""What are these Indians?"" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. ""Gauchos!"" replied the Patagonian. ""Gauchos!"" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, ""Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to fear!"" ""Why?"" asked the major. ""Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants."" ""Do you think so, Paganel?"" ""Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled."" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he expected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it was necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that evening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced that the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour afterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious disappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana and Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place to obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly impregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the sun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake Salinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in many places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was general when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake Salinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern bottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which began to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to this imperative want. A ""roukah,"" a kind of upright tent, of leather, which stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served as a refuge for"
